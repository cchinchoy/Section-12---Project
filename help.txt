How to Play War
1. Each player should place the top card of their deck face up in the center.
2. Whoever placed the larger card may take both cards and add them to the bottom of their pile. Aces are high.
3. In the rare case that both players set down the same number, then a war begins. For purposes of this game however,
   war is an automatic process and the winner is chosen by the ranking suit (H/D/S/C).
4. The game continues until one player has won all the cards! The player with all the cards wins the game!
5. You can end the game at anytime that you want, the player with the biggest deck count wins.....
GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
